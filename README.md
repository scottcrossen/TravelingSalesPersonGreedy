# Greedy Traveling Sales Person Algorithm

A greedy approximation to the traveling sales person.

### Description

This repository was coded in C# and designed to solve the traveling sales person problem. 
This problem involves charting a course for a sales person to travel between different cities.
Paths between cities have a characteristic distance and the goal of the problem is to reach all cities while minimizing the overall path distance.
The basic idea of the greedy algorithm was to add each point to the partial-solution one at a time according to whatever one had the minimal cost to add.
The basic idea of the branch-and-bound algorithm is that it would score possible routes based on an estimated lower-bound to their solution. The algorithm would then prune those possible paths that were obviously not near the correct solution. Given enough time this algorithm could find the optimal path that solves the problem.
