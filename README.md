# Greedy Traveling Sales Person Algorithm

A greedy approximation to the traveling sales person.

### Description

This repository was coded in C# and designed to solve the traveling sales person problem. 
This problem involves charting a course for a sales person to travel between different cities.
Paths between cities have a characteristic distance and the goal of the problem is to reach all cities while minimizing the overall path distance.
The basic idea of this algorithm was to add each point to the partial-solution one at a time according to whatever one had the minimal cost to add.
It is written and maintained by Scott Leland Crossen.
